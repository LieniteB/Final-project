                    <h1 class="centered">It all started simple</h1>
                    <p>As everyone does, Ksenija and Liene decided to set some new goals for 2022. They were both keen on changing their lives for the better - excercising, eating healthier, making new friends and having more fun. And the first thing they
                        both decided to tackle was the goal to read more. But just as one does, they would procrastinate and fail. So they both thought... What could make them more motivatated to read? What would be an easy way to make reading a new exciting
                        habit for them? And thus, with just a single New Year's resolution an idea was born.
