                <h4>365 NEW DAYS 365 NEW CHANCES </h4>
                <h1>It all started simple</h1>
                <p>As everyone does, me and Liene set some new goals for 2022. We were both keen on changing out lives for the better, exercising, eating healthier, making new friends and having more fun. And the first thing we both decided to tackle first
                    was our goal to read more. But just as one does, we would procrastinate and fail. So we thought... What could make us motivate to read more? What would be an easy way to make reading a new exciting habit for us? And thus, with just
                    a single New Year's resolution a new idea was born. </p>

            </div>

                <h4>AN EASY WAY FOR A NEW HABIT</h4>
                <h1>We made it simple and convenient</h1>
                <p>BookWorms is there to make reading exciting again. We are here to help you stick to your goals of not giving up on books by making reading them your new habit. Just imagine how convenient would it be to recieve a new book every month or
                    2 or 3? (whatever, you are the boss, tell us how often you would like to recieve a new package yourself!) Just how easy would it be to leave the hard part of indecisiveness of what to read next in our hands? We will pick out just the
                    right book for you. </p>

                <h4>WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER</h4>
                <h1>It's not just books</h1>
                <p>So how does it work? I'll just get a new usless subscription? Not exactly. We offer you not only the chance to motivate yourself by providing you with great content on timely manner, but also provide you with a new community for you! Every
                    BookWorms reader gets and acces to our blog where everyone is more than welcome to discuss the latest books. You are more likely to stick to a new habit by sharing your experiance with others and it's scientifiaclly proven!(at least
                    we think so) </p>
